The purpose of the currency converter app is to give consumers an easy-to-use and effective solution for converting currencies on their Android smartphones. An outline of the application and the technologies needed to implement it is provided below:

1. Currency Conversion: The app's main feature lets users enter a sum in one currency and see how much it would be in another. To assure correctness, this entails retrieving the most recent currency rates from an external API.


2. Currency Selection: From a list of available currencies, users have the opportunity to choose the source and target currencies. There are two ways to make this choosing process easier: dropdown menus and search functions.


3. Real-Time Exchange Rates: To get the most recent exchange rate information, integration with a reputable currency exchange rate API is essential. For this, APIs like CurrencyLayer and Open Exchange Rates are frequently used.


4. Offline Mode: The program has the ability to locally cache current exchange rates on the device in order to improve usability. Because of this, users can execute conversions even with spotty or no connectivity.


5. Conversion History: Users may simply evaluate past conversions by using the app, which keeps track of their conversion history. For this feature, conversion data is usually stored either remotely in a cloud-based database or locally on the device.

6. Configuration: Users can tailor the application's settings to suit their own tastes. This could involve defining various display options, changing decimal places, or setting default currencies.

7. Material Design: A consistent and user-friendly user experience is guaranteed when one follows Google's Material Design guidelines. Making use of Material Design elements and principles aids in producing an application that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.

8. Android Studio :The main integrated development environment (IDE) for creating Android apps is called Android Studio. A collection of tools for creating, troubleshooting, and testing Android apps is offered by Android Studio.

The two main programming languages used to create Android applications are Java and Kotlin. In particular, Kotlin has become more well-known due to its cutting-edge functionality and smooth Java integration.

SQLite Database: SQLite databases are frequently used to store conversion history locally on the device. When it comes to organizing structured data in Android applications, SQLite provides a portable and effective option.

Networking Libraries: To effectively manage network requests and API interactions, libraries like Volley or Retrofit are frequently utilized. These packages make it easier to handle JSON answers and make HTTP queries.

Version Control System (e.g., Git/GitHub): A version control system is essential for managing the application codebase and collaborating with team members. Platforms like GitHub provide a centralized repository for hosting the project and tracking changes over time.
